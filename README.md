Interinstitutional Agreement CNR API
====================================

* [What is the status of this document?][statuses]
* [See the index of all other EWP Specifications][develhub]


Summary
-------

This document describes the **Interinstitutional Agreement CNR API**.
This API is implemented by the all EWP partners, and called by **EWP IIA
Repository** whenever related IIAs are changed. It allows the partners to
listen for changes in all of their IIAs.


Request method
--------------

 * Requests MUST be made with HTTP POST method. Servers MAY reject all other
   request methods.


Request parameters
------------------

Parameters MUST be provided in the `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` format.


### `iia_id` (repeatable, required)

A list of IIA identifiers - IDs of agreements that were recently updated (in
the *EWP IIA Repository*).

This parameter is *repeatable*, so the request MAY contain multiple occurrences
of it. The server SHOULD process all of them.


Permissions
-----------

* Servers MUST allow this API to be called *at least* by **EWP IIA
  Repository** (you can determine it by looking at the `<apis-implemented>` of
  the caller, as you did in [Echo API][echo]).

* Implementers MAY allow this API to be called by other clients too (but it is
  not required).


Handling of invalid parameters
------------------------------

 * General [error handling rules][error-handling] apply.

 * Please note, that receiving unknown `iia_id` values is NOT an error. This
   usually indicates that a new IIA for your institution has been created, and
   you probably want to fetch it. Servers MUST return a valid (HTTP 200) XML
   response whenever the request has been properly received.


Response
--------

Servers MUST respond with a valid XML document described by the [response.xsd]
(response.xsd) schema. See the schema annotations for further information.
